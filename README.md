# my_awesome
This is my configuration of the Awesome Window Manager I am using with Arch Linux.
From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awesome_(window_manager)):
>Awesome is a dynamic window manager for the X Window System developed in the C and Lua programming languages.
>Lua is also used for configuring and extending the window manager.

Some of the features that are incorporated in this configuration are 
- logout option
- battery widget
- volume controller 
- etc

I made it it too simple without any fancy additions as i was just exploring wht it could od and also introducing myself to Lua as programming language.
