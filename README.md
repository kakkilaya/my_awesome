# my_awesome
This is my configuration of the Awesome Window Manager I am using with Arch Linux.
From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awesome_(window_manager)):
>Awesome is a dynamic window manager for the X Window System developed in the C and Lua programming languages.
>Lua is also used for configuring and extending the window manager.

Awesome is named after the same phrase used by the [How I Met Your Mother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother) character [Barney Stinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Stinson#Catchphrases).

More about the Awesome Window Manager in the [official website](http://awesome.naquadah.org/).
